# Customer Assignment Display Fix

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED**

### **🔍 Problem:**
In the customer dashboard, when viewing service request details, the "Assigned To" field was showing both service and EPR team members (e.g., "mukesh@test.com, mohit@test.com") instead of just the service team member.

### **🔧 Solution Implemented:**

#### **Before:**
```typescript
{request.assigned_to && (
  <div className="mb-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
      <svg className="w-5 h-5 text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 mr-2" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M16 7a4 4 0 11-8 0 4 4 0 018 0zM12 14a7 7 0 00-7 7h14a7 7 0 00-7-7z" />
      </svg>
      <span className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
        Assigned to: <span className="font-semibold">{request.assigned_to}</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

#### **After:**
```typescript
{request.assigned_service_team && (
  <div className="mb-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
      <svg className="w-5 h-5 text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 mr-2" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M16 7a4 4 0 11-8 0 4 4 0 018 0zM12 14a7 7 0 00-7 7h14a7 7 0 00-7-7z" />
      </svg>
      <span className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
        Assigned to: <span className="font-semibold">{request.assigned_service_team}</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### **🎯 What Changed:**

1. **Field Reference**: Changed from `request.assigned_to` to `request.assigned_service_team`
2. **Condition Check**: Changed from `request.assigned_to &&` to `request.assigned_service_team &&`
3. **Display Value**: Now shows only the service team member (e.g., "mukesh@test.com" instead of "mukesh@test.com, mohit@test.com")

### **✅ Result:**
- ✅ **Customer Dashboard**: Now shows only the service team member in "Assigned To" field
- ✅ **Clean Display**: No more confusing comma-separated assignments
- ✅ **User Experience**: Customers see only the relevant service team member
- ✅ **Backend Logic**: EPR assignments remain hidden from customers (as intended)

### **🔒 Why This Makes Sense:**
- **Customers** only need to know who their service contact is (service team member)
- **EPR team members** are internal and don't need to be visible to customers
- **Service team members** are the primary customer-facing contacts
- **Clean separation** of concerns between customer-facing and internal assignments

The customer dashboard now properly displays only the service team member in the "Assigned To" field, providing a cleaner and more relevant user experience!
