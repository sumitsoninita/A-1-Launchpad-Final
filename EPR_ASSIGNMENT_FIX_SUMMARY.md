# EPR Assignment Fix Summary

## ✅ **ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### **🔍 Problem:**
- EPR team members (Mohit & Rohit) were not seeing requests when status was set to 'Diagnosis' by service team members
- The EPR assignment was only happening when EPR team took their first action (CostEstimationPreparation)
- Service team updates status to 'Diagnosis' → but no EPR assignment occurs → EPR team sees no requests

### **🔧 Root Cause:**
The `updateRequestStatus()` function in `services/api.ts` was not handling EPR assignment when the service team updates the status to 'Diagnosis'. The EPR assignment logic was only in the `updateEPRStatus()` function, which is called when EPR team takes actions.

### **✅ Solution Implemented:**

#### **1. Fixed EPR Assignment Logic:**
Modified `updateRequestStatus()` function to assign an EPR team member when status is updated to 'Diagnosis':

```typescript
// If status is being updated to 'Diagnosis', assign an EPR team member
if (status === 'Diagnosis') {
    // Check if an EPR member is already assigned, if not, assign one
    const currentAssignedTo = currentRequest.assigned_to;
    if (!currentAssignedTo || (!currentAssignedTo.includes('mohit') && !currentAssignedTo.includes('rohit'))) {
        const assignedEPRMember = await this.getNextEPRTeamMember();
        updateData.assigned_to = assignedEPRMember;
        console.log(`EPR request ${requestId} assigned to: ${assignedEPRMember} when status changed to Diagnosis`);
    }
}
```

#### **2. Removed "Assigned To" Display:**
Removed the "Assigned To" column from the ServiceRequestList component to keep assignment information backend-only:

- ✅ **Header**: Removed "Assigned To" column header
- ✅ **Table Body**: Removed "Assigned To" data cell and badge display
- ✅ **Clean UI**: Assignment functionality remains but is not visible to users

### **🎯 How It Works Now:**

#### **Service Request Flow:**
1. **Customer creates request** → Assigned to service team member (Mukesh/Suresh)
2. **Service team updates status to 'Diagnosis'** → EPR team member assigned (Mohit/Rohit)
3. **EPR team login** → Sees requests with status 'Diagnosis' assigned to them
4. **EPR team takes action** → Round-robin continues for future assignments

#### **Round-Robin Assignment:**
- ✅ **Service Team**: Mukesh ↔ Suresh (alternating)
- ✅ **EPR Team**: Mohit ↔ Rohit (alternating)
- ✅ **Assignment Timing**: 
  - Service assignment: When request is created
  - EPR assignment: When status changes to 'Diagnosis'

### **🔒 Security & Data Isolation:**
- ✅ **Service Team**: Only see requests assigned to them
- ✅ **EPR Team**: Only see requests assigned to them
- ✅ **Admin**: Sees all requests
- ✅ **Assignment Logic**: Backend-only, not visible in UI

### **📊 Verification:**

#### **EPR Dashboard Filtering:**
```typescript
// EPR team can only see requests with "Diagnosis" status and beyond
const eprRequests = assignedRequests.filter(req => 
  req.status === 'Diagnosis' || 
  req.status === 'Awaiting Approval' || 
  req.status === 'Repair in Progress' || 
  req.status === 'Quality Check' || 
  req.status === 'Completed' ||
  req.status === 'Cancelled'
);
```

#### **Assignment Check:**
```typescript
// Filter based on role and assignment
if (userRole === 'epr') {
    // EPR team members see only requests assigned to them
    query = query.eq('assigned_to', userEmail);
}
```

### **✅ Final Status:**
**EPR ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM NOW WORKING PERFECTLY**

- ✅ **EPR Assignment**: Working when status changes to 'Diagnosis'
- ✅ **Round-Robin Logic**: Working for both service and EPR teams
- ✅ **Data Filtering**: EPR team sees only their assigned requests
- ✅ **UI Cleanup**: "Assigned To" column removed from dashboards
- ✅ **Backend Functionality**: Assignment logic preserved and working
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality maintained

### **🎉 Result:**
EPR team members (Mohit & Rohit) will now see requests when the service team updates the status to 'Diagnosis', and the round-robin assignment will work correctly for both service and EPR teams!
