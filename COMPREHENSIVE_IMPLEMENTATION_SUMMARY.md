## âœ… All Systems Updated and Verified

### ðŸ”§ **Database Schema Changes**
- âœ… **team_assignments table** created for round-robin tracking

- âœ… **Rohit** (rohit@test.com) - Password: rohit123 *(new account)*

### ðŸ”„ **Round-Robin Assignment System**
- âœ… **Service Request Assignment**: Automatically assigns to Mukesh â†” Suresh
- âœ… **EPR Assignment**: Automatically assigns to Mohit â†” Rohit
- âœ… **Assignment Tracking**: Database tracks last assigned member

- âœ… **List View**: ServiceRequestList shows "Assigned To" column with team member names
- âœ… **Visual Indicators**: Blue badges for assigned members, "Unassigned" for empty
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

### ðŸ”§ **API Updates**
- âœ… **Password Validation**: Updated for all new team member accounts
- âœ… **Assignment Functions**: `getNextServiceTeamMember()` and `getNextEPRTeamMember()`

### ðŸ“± **User Experience**
- âœ… **Same Dashboards**: Team members see identical interfaces as before
- âœ… **Clear Assignment**: Easy to see which requests are assigned to whom
- âœ… **Automatic Distribution**: No manual assignment needed
- âœ… **Fair Workload**: Requests distributed evenly between team members

### ðŸ”’ **Security & Access**
- âœ… **Role-Based Access**: Service members get AdminDashboard, EPR members get EPRDashboard
- âœ… **Individual Logins**: Each team member has unique credentials
- âœ… **Audit Trail**: All assignments logged in database
- âœ… **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**

### **For Service Requests:**
1. Customer creates service request
2. System automatically assigns to Mukesh or Suresh (alternating)
3. Assigned member sees request in their dashboard
4. Console logs: `Service request req-123 assigned to: mukesh@test.com`

### **For EPR Requests:**
1. Service team initiates EPR involvement
2. System automatically assigns to Mohit or Rohit (alternating)
3. Assigned EPR member sees request in their dashboard
4. Console logs: `EPR request req-123 assigned to: mohit@test.com`

### **For Team Members:**
- **Mukesh & Suresh**: Login with individual credentials, see AdminDashboard
- **Mohit & Rohit**: Login with individual credentials, see EPRDashboard
- **Assignment Visibility**: Can see which requests are assigned to them
- **Same Functionality**: All existing features work exactly as before

## ðŸ“Š **Database Structure**

### **team_assignments Table:**
```sql
id: 'assignment-tracker'
service_team_last_assigned: 'mukesh@test.com' (or 'suresh@test.com')
epr_team_last_assigned: 'mohit@test.com' (or 'rohit@test.com')
updated_at: timestamp
```

### **app_users Table Updates:**
- Updated existing accounts with new emails and names
- Created new accounts with all required columns
- Set proper timestamps and user flags
