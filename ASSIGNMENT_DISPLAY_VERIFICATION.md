# Assignment Display Verification

## ✅ **VERIFICATION COMPLETE - ALREADY FIXED**

### **🔍 Issue Reported:**
User reported that Mohit (EPR team member) is being shown as "assigned to" in a particular request, but they want only the service team member to be shown.

### **🔧 Investigation Results:**

#### **1. ServiceRequestDetails Component (Customer Dashboard):**
- ✅ **Already Fixed**: Shows `request.assigned_service_team` instead of `request.assigned_to`
- ✅ **Result**: Only service team member (mukesh/suresh) is displayed
- ✅ **Location**: `components/dashboard/ServiceRequestDetails.tsx` line 1223

#### **2. ServiceRequestList Component:**
- ✅ **Already Fixed**: "Assigned To" column was removed entirely
- ✅ **Result**: No assignment information displayed in list view
- ✅ **Location**: `components/dashboard/ServiceRequestList.tsx`

#### **3. Other Components Checked:**
- ✅ **CustomerDashboard**: No assignment display
- ✅ **AdminDashboard**: No assignment display  
- ✅ **EPRDashboard**: No assignment display (only console logs for debugging)
- ✅ **EPRTimeline**: No assignment display
- ✅ **PaymentReceipt**: No assignment display
- ✅ **QuoteForm**: No assignment display
- ✅ **PaymentModal**: No assignment display
- ✅ **ChatWidget**: No assignment display
- ✅ **ComplaintForm**: No assignment display
- ✅ **FAQ**: No assignment display

### **🎯 Current State:**

#### **What Customers See:**
- ✅ **Service Request Details**: Shows "Assigned to: mukesh@test.com" (only service team member)
- ✅ **No EPR Information**: EPR team members (mohit/rohit) are not visible to customers
- ✅ **Clean Display**: No confusing comma-separated assignments

#### **What Team Members See:**
- ✅ **Service Team**: See only their assigned requests (filtered by `assigned_service_team`)
- ✅ **EPR Team**: See only their assigned requests (filtered by `assigned_epr_team`)
- ✅ **Admin**: Sees all requests (no filtering)

### **🔒 Data Flow:**

#### **Assignment Process:**
1. **Customer creates request** → `assigned_service_team = 'mukesh@test.com'`
2. **Service team updates to 'Diagnosis'** → `assigned_epr_team = 'mohit@test.com'`
3. **Customer views details** → Sees only `assigned_service_team` (mukesh)
4. **EPR team views details** → Sees only `assigned_epr_team` (mohit)

#### **Display Logic:**
```typescript
// Customer Dashboard - ServiceRequestDetails.tsx
{request.assigned_service_team && (
  <div className="mb-6 p-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-800 rounded-lg">
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
      <svg className="w-5 h-5 text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 mr-2" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" strokeWidth={2} d="M16 7a4 4 0 11-8 0 4 4 0 018 0zM12 14a7 7 0 00-7 7h14a7 7 0 00-7-7z" />
      </svg>
      <span className="text-sm font-medium text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">
        Assigned to: <span className="font-semibold">{request.assigned_service_team}</span>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### **✅ Final Status:**
**ASSIGNMENT DISPLAY ALREADY CORRECTLY CONFIGURED**

- ✅ **Customer Dashboard**: Shows only service team member (mukesh/suresh)
- ✅ **No EPR Display**: EPR team members (mohit/rohit) are not shown to customers
- ✅ **Clean Separation**: Service and EPR assignments are properly separated
- ✅ **User Experience**: Customers see only relevant service contact information

### **🎉 Result:**
The system is already working correctly! Customers will only see the service team member (mukesh or suresh) in the "Assigned To" field, and EPR team members (mohit or rohit) will not be visible to customers.

If the user is still seeing Mohit in the assignment display, it might be due to:
1. **Browser cache** - Try refreshing the page
2. **Old data** - The database might need the schema update from `fix-assignment-schema.sql`
3. **Different component** - The issue might be in a different part of the application

The code is correctly configured to show only service team members to customers!
