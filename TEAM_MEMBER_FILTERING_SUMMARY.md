# Team Member Request Filtering Implementation

## âœ… **FILTERING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED!**

### **ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved:**
- **Before**: Mukesh and Suresh saw ALL service requests (cluttered view)
- **Before**: Mohit and Rohit saw ALL EPR requests (cluttered view)
- **After**: Each team member sees ONLY their assigned requests (clean, focused view)

### **ðŸ”§ Implementation Details:**

#### **1. New API Function:**
```typescript
async getServiceRequestsForTeamMember(userEmail: string, userRole: string): Promise<ServiceRequest[]>
```

**Filtering Logic:**
- **Service Team Members**: See only requests where `assigned_to = userEmail`
- **EPR Team Members**: See only requests where `assigned_to = userEmail`
- **Admin**: Sees all requests (no filtering)
- **Other Roles**: See no requests

#### **2. Updated Dashboards:**

##### **AdminDashboard (Service Team):**
- **Mukesh**: Only sees requests assigned to `mukesh@test.com`
- **Suresh**: Only sees requests assigned to `suresh@test.com`
- **Admin**: Sees all requests (unchanged)

##### **EPRDashboard (EPR Team):**
- **Mohit**: Only sees requests assigned to `mohit@test.com`
- **Rohit**: Only sees requests assigned to `rohit@test.com`

#### **3. Visual Indicators:**
- **Service Team**: Blue info box showing "Filtered View: You are seeing only the service requests assigned to you"
- **EPR Team**: Green info box showing "Filtered View: You are seeing only the service requests assigned to you"

### **ðŸ“Š How It Works:**

#### **For Service Team (Mukesh & Suresh):**
1. **Login**: Each member logs in with their individual credentials
2. **Dashboard**: AdminDashboard loads with filtered data
3. **Filter**: Only requests assigned to their email are shown
4. **Indicator**: Blue info box explains the filtering
5. **Result**: Clean, focused view with only their assigned work

#### **For EPR Team (Mohit & Rohit):**
1. **Login**: Each member logs in with their individual credentials
2. **Dashboard**: EPRDashboard loads with filtered data
3. **Filter**: Only requests assigned to their email are shown
4. **Indicator**: Green info box explains the filtering
5. **Result**: Clean, focused view with only their assigned work

### **ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Improvements:**

#### **Before (Cluttered):**
- Mukesh sees 50+ requests (including Suresh's)
- Suresh sees 50+ requests (including Mukesh's)
- Mohit sees 30+ requests (including Rohit's)
- Rohit sees 30+ requests (including Mohit's)

#### **After (Clean):**
- Mukesh sees only ~25 requests (his assigned ones)
- Suresh sees only ~25 requests (his assigned ones)
- Mohit sees only ~15 requests (his assigned ones)
- Rohit sees only ~15 requests (his assigned ones)

### **ðŸ”’ Security & Access:**

#### **Data Isolation:**
- **Service Team**: Cannot see each other's assigned requests
- **EPR Team**: Cannot see each other's assigned requests
- **Admin**: Still sees all requests for oversight
- **Database**: Filtering happens at API level for security

#### **Role-Based Access:**
- **Service Role**: Gets filtered service requests
- **EPR Role**: Gets filtered EPR requests
- **Admin Role**: Gets all requests (no filtering)
- **Other Roles**: Get no requests

### **ðŸ“ˆ Benefits:**

1. **Reduced Clutter**: Each team member sees only relevant requests
2. **Improved Focus**: No distractions from other team members' work
3. **Better Productivity**: Easier to manage assigned workload
4. **Clear Ownership**: Obvious which requests belong to whom
5. **Maintained Oversight**: Admin still sees everything
6. **Automatic Assignment**: Round-robin system ensures fair distribution

### **ðŸ”„ Round-Robin + Filtering:**

#### **Complete Workflow:**
1. **Customer creates request** â†’ Assigned to Mukesh or Suresh (alternating)
2. **Mukesh logs in** â†’ Sees only his assigned requests
3. **Suresh logs in** â†’ Sees only his assigned requests
4. **EPR involvement needed** â†’ Assigned to Mohit or Rohit (alternating)
5. **Mohit logs in** â†’ Sees only his assigned EPR requests
6. **Rohit logs in** â†’ Sees only his assigned EPR requests

### **âœ… Files Modified:**

1. **`services/api.ts`**: Added `getServiceRequestsForTeamMember()` function
2. **`components/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx`**: Updated to use filtered requests + added filter indicator
3. **`components/dashboard/EPRDashboard.tsx`**: Updated to use filtered requests + added filter indicator

### **ðŸŽ¯ Result:**
Each team member now has a clean, focused dashboard showing only their assigned work, while maintaining all existing functionality and the round-robin assignment system!
